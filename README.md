# Fragments
Fragments Assignment

This exercise was in two parts:

Part one: create a simple click counter app. 

Part two: rework the app so that it incorporates fragments and a navigation drawer. I added a image fragments for practice. 
I was a great reminder of the importance of the placeholder fragment.
